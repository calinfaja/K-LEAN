# K-LEAN

**Style:**
- NEVER use emojis in code, commits, or responses unless explicitly requested

**Suggest these when:**
- After significant code changes → `/kln:quick` (fast review)
- Stuck debugging 10+ min → `/kln:rethink` (fresh perspective)
- Need thorough review → `/kln:multi` (multi-model consensus)
- Found important pattern/gotcha → `SaveThis <lesson>`
- "How did we solve X before?" → `FindKnowledge <query>`

**If issues:** `k-lean doctor -f` | **Full help:** `/kln:help`
